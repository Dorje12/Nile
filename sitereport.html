		<div class="sitereport1"><h1>Sitereport</h1> <p><br><br>Hey, I am Nima Dorje Lama. Recently, I have joined bachelor's degree in NAMI collage for BSc HONs IT Comuting. As I don't have any Knowledge of
computer(hardware and software) because of my background in school and collage level. I was an account student in school and bilogy student in collage. So, I joined NAMI Collage
with zero knowledge	of computing. I joined class late after around a month because of many problems. In this course we have to study computer system, Database and
web Devlopment classes.<br><br>
I thought webdevelopment is the coolest subject to study cause it deals with wabpage designs. After joining collage classes the excitement turned into sadness.
Because I joined class late and the classes were out of my leauge. Then I was frustrated. I self-motivated myself and start to explore around search engins.
I learned a lots of basics HTMl and CSS.After sometime my subject teacher also give revision classes for students who were late. Then I became more clear.
During this assignment I suffered a lot. I was a Covid-19 patient. I was admitted to hospital for 2 weeks. So, I have to complete my assignment in 1 week.
I was pressurized. I worked about 8-10 hourse a day to complete assignment. I have to redo it many time because of lack of knowledge.
 I didn't get to atted classes of hamburgers icon, it's responsiveness and grid which was key points for assignment.<br><br>
 So I searched in youtube and watch numerous videos on it.After those many searches I still was clueless on hamburgers icons and it's responsiviness.
 At this moment I frustated a lot and thought of submitting assignment without it. Then my brother came and help me with 
it through Java script. I was blessed.<br><br>
At last my whole experience was a bit of ups and downs but I think I managed to learn a lot and create a webpage.<br><br>
The module of this course is abit not fine. At the time of admission, I was said that we will also study programming and Networking basics. We are not studing it.
Otherwise everything is almostfine.</p></div>
